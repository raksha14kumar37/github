What is an Operating System? Defination, types, and featuresAn operating system (OS) is the core software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources, acting as an intermediary between the user and the computer. It handles fundamental tasks like memory and file management, controls input/output devices, and provides common services for applications to run. Popular examples include Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS and iOS, Google Android, and Linux.

What an Operating System Does
Manages Hardware: It controls the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, and peripheral devices like printers and keyboards. 
Manages Software: It coordinates multiple programs and applications, ensuring they have the resources they need to run efficiently and without conflict. 
Provides a User Interface: It allows users to interact with the computer through a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI). 
Allocates Resources: It allocates system resources, such as memory and processor time, to different programs as needed. 
Handles Files: It manages the organization, storage, and retrieval of files on a device.

Why Operating Systems Are Important
Enables Usability: Without an OS, a computer would be an unusable collection of hardware. 
Simplifies Development: Operating systems provide a consistent environment, allowing developers to focus on creating applications rather than low-level hardware interactions. 
Ensures Smooth Operation: By coordinating all system functions, the OS helps to keep devices running smoothly and efficiently. 
Common Types of Operating Systems
Desktop/Laptop OS: Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux. 
Mobile OS: Google Android and Apple iOS, designed for smartphones and tablets.
